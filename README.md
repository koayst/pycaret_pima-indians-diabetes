Test out PyCaret to determine the workflow convenience it promised.

PyCaret, an open source low-code machine learning library in Python, was announced on 16 April 2020.  It promises to be an alternate low-code library that can be used to replace hundreds of lines of code with few words only. This makes experiments exponentially fast and efficient.

This is like a dream come true for many Data Science Engineers.  I will attempt to prove or disapprove it by comparing the workflow with one of the projects I did on Pima Indian datasets.  In that project, I was using XGBoost algorithm to predict the patient diabetic inclination.

This is a binary classification problem.
